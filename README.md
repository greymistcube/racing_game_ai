# Dependencies

[![pygame][pygame_img]][pygame_url]
[![numpy][numpy_img]][numpy_url]

This project only requires `numpy` and `pygame` packages to run.
To install the required packages, run the following commands.
```
pip install numpy
pip install pygame
```

# Usage

Run with

```
python game.py
```

to start the game normally in a playable mode with the default settings.
Various command line arguments may be passed on to change the settings.
For example,

```
python game.py -z3 -n200 neat
```

will start the game with 3x display zoom and 200 cars per generation for
the AI to train on. For more help, run the program with `-h` as its argument.

# Controls

Use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>&larr;</kbd>, and
<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys to control the car. Number keys
<kbd>0</kbd>, ..., <kbd>9</kbd> may be used to change the game speed.
This is mainly used to speed up the training process for the AI.
Use <kbd>i</kbd> to toggle the information overlay and <kbd>d</kbd>
to show the debug screen.
