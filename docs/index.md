# Racing Game with NEAT

![Game Screen](./img/racing_game_ai_peek.gif)

This is a continuation of my previous project
[Flappy Bird Clone with NEAT.](https://github.com/greymistcube/flappy_bird_ai)
If you want to know about how this particular AI works in general,
please visit the page for my previous project.

This project was started with two main goals in mind:
 
 * Use the NEAT algorithm made for the flappy bird clone game as a backend
 with as little change as possible.
 * Simulate an autonomous driving environment by limiting the kind of
 information that gets fed to the AI.

# Very Nonlinear Nature of the Game

# Chossing the Variables

# Installing Sensors

# Inside the AI's Mind
